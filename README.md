# My Developer Journey

# Overview
This repository documents my structured journey to becoming a proficient backend and cloud developer by 2027. It captures my learning progress from foundational languages like C and Java to advanced backend, distributed systems, and cloud technologies including Go, Rust, Redis, Kafka, Docker, and Kubernetes.

The goal is to build a strong, long-term foundation while maintaining a clear record of growth, projects, and reflections.

# Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations
1. **C (1–2 months)**  
   Memory management, pointers, low-level logic.
2. **Java (2 months)**  
   Core backend language, OOP, collections, concurrency basics.
3. **Git + Linux basics (1 month)**  
   Version control and command-line survival skills.
4. **SQL + Databases (2 months)**  
   MySQL/PostgreSQL, queries, joins, indexing, normalization.

### Phase 2: Backend Expertise
5. **Spring Boot (2–3 months)**  
   REST APIs, dependency injection, Spring Data, security, microservices basics.
6. **DevOps fundamentals (2 months)**  
   Docker, CI/CD, Linux admin, Nginx, logging, monitoring.
7. **Cloud provider (2 months)**  
   AWS or GCP: EC2, IAM, VPC, S3, RDS.

### Phase 3: Modern Backend Strength
8. **Redis (3–4 weeks)**  
   Caching, session storage, pub/sub.
9. **Kafka (1–2 months)**  
   Event-driven systems, consumer groups, offsets, partitions.
10. **Kubernetes (2 months)**  
    Deployments, services, scaling, cluster management.

### Phase 4: Systems Programming Lane
11. **Go (2 months)**  
    Microservices, concurrency, high-performance backend.
12. **Rust (3–4 months)**  
    Memory safety, async, systems-level backend.
