**Week 1(17th - 23rd Nov, 2025)**

**Focus:** Learning the basics of C from the first 200 pages of Modern C by K.N. King.

**What I Learned:**
- Structure of a C program (headers, main function, statements)
- Data types: int, float, double, char
- Variables: declaration and initialization
- Operators: arithmetic, relational, logical
- Input and output using printf and scanf
- Control flow: if, if-else, switch
- Loops: for, while, do-while
- Compiling programs with gcc and reading error messages

**Challenges:**
- Remembering the correct syntax
- Using loops and conditionals without errors
- Handling input and output correctly

**Next Steps:**
- Practice simple programs using loops and conditionals
- Write small programs to reinforce what I have learned
- Start experimenting with different input/output formats
